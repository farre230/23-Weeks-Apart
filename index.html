			<h1>23 WEEKS APART</h1>
			<p id="introtext">We had only just started dating about a month before and the 160 days stretched in front of us like one long, terrifying obstacle course. Steven was leaving for 23 weeks to study abroad in Toledo, Spain. Julia was staying in Minneapolis at the University of Minnesota working towards her design degree. Over the course of the semester, we shared thousands of texts, facebook messages, photos, and skype calls. This website tells the story of our long distance relationship through 23 conversations - one for every week that we were apart.</p>

I'm not sure whether to acknowledge it, or focus on other parts of our relationship and try to ignore physical closeness. I don't know - I don't want to not be able to talk about it, but it's difficult to talk about it without an element of longing creeping in. Maybe an element of longing, in that situation, is healthy? I don't know. Maybe I should just treat such thoughts with a sort of, "Well, we can't now - but when we do, it's going to be fantastic. In the meantime, it'll still be great." I love you. Waaayyy a lot. It's a beyond words sort of thing, but we know how big the feeling is. And I like *trying* to do that bigness justice with words.
