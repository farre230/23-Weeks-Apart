			<h1>23 WEEKS APART</h1>
			<p id="introtext">We had only just started dating about a month before and the 160 days stretched in front of us like one long, terrifying obstacle course. Steven was leaving for 23 weeks to study abroad in Toledo, Spain. Julia was staying in Minneapolis at the University of Minnesota working towards her design degree. Over the course of the semester, we shared thousands of texts, facebook messages, photos, and skype calls. This website tells the story of our long distance relationship through 23 conversations - one for every week that we were apart.</p>

We're both in different days again... Which is totally fun to think about. *Sighhh* It’s strange, but it feels like my heart moved from one side of the planet to the other  when you got on that plane. I think it’s because a part of me is always with you. I hope you’re not feeling too homesick (I know if I was in your place, I might be feeling it a little bit…). Everything probably seems a little crazy and exhausting right now but you’re going to be absolutely fine. Better than fine. If you’re ever feeling low/homesick/overwhelmed, just remember that your family and I are thinking of you and supporting you and sending you love.”</p>

The hardest part for me with this change is going to be figuring out how to NOT constantly be thinking of you and longing for you and pining after you. Like you said, we have to figure out our own personal ways of being *content* with the situation. *Sighh* Honestly, I haven't decided how on earth I'm going to do that, yet. Let me know if you have any brilliant ideas. I just want you to know how lucky I feel to have you. And I'll wait for you forever and follow you anywhere. Sleep well. I love you. It feels especially wonderful to say that on Christmas.”</p>

I was feeling a bit of that last night (thinking and longing and pining for you). Well, maybe more than a bit. I'm not sure whether to acknowledge it, or focus on other parts of our relationship and try to ignore physical closeness. I don't know - I don't want to not be able to talk about it, but it's difficult to talk about it without an element of longing creeping in. Maybe an element of longing, in that situation, is healthy? I don't know. Maybe I should just treat such thoughts with a sort of, "Well, we can't now - but when we do, it's going to be fantastic. In the meantime, it'll still be great." I love you. Waaayyy a lot. It's a beyond words sort of thing, but we know how big the feeling is. And I like *trying* to do that bigness justice with words. I love you through the warm cuddlingy night and the wavery sunrise, past the end of days. Merry Christmas.”</p>

It hasn’t changed in the way you describe, but I love that image, of a part of your mind and heart always being with me wherever I go – the same is true for me to you; I just haven’t noticed my feelings for you being directed to a geographically different spot. Maybe it’s ‘cause you didn’t move; only I did. I do know, though, that literally everything I see, I see with the lens of “I can’t wait to tell Julia about this.” And with so many exciting things/sights, I’m thinking that all day. <br><br>Buenas noches, amor de mi vida.
